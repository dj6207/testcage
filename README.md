# Introduction
Test Cage is a Desktop Application built using the [Tauri-framework](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites). The frontend (UI) is built using Typescript React, the backend is built using Rust, and SQLite is used for the database. The purpose of this application is to sign out and return Test Fixtures and Test Samples and store a database of all Test Fixtures, Test Samples, and Sign Out Logs.

# Installing/Development
The source code for the Test Cage application is located in [Azure-Dev-ops](https://dev.azure.com/FLC-Embedded/HW-Test/_git/TestCageSignout). To initialize this repository for development follow the steps below.

1. Install `Node.js (LTS)`. Check if Node.js is install on you computer by typing in `node` in either `cmd ` or `powershell`. It should display the Node version installed on the computer. Link to Node install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Install `Rust`. Check if Rust is install on you computer by typing in `rustc -V` or `rustc --version` in either `cmd ` or `powershell`. It should display the current Rust version installed on the computer. Link to Rust install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
3. Install `DB Browser for Sqlite (Optional)`. DB Browser can be very helpful to view and manually modify the database. Link to DB Browser Install [DB Browser for Sqlite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/).
4. Clone the repository into a folder and open the folder with the text editor/IDE of your choosing.
5. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies for the frontend react code.
6. Run `cargo install tauri-cli`
7. Run `cargo tauri dev` to run the desktop application in development. This might take a while when first building the project. The application should launch once the build finishes.

## Debugging Tools Frontend (Typescript React)
Open the `DevTools` for the frontend by right clicking the Application and click on inspect. The `DevTools` should open. The console tab should display all the Errors, Warnings and Console Logs if any. To start logging use `console.log("Stuff you want to log");`.

## Debugging Tools Backend (Rust)
You can use Rust's built in unit testing for testing various functions. Link to documentation can be found here [Unit-Testing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/testing/unit_testing.html). To start logging use `log::info!("Stuff you want to log")`.

## Debugging Tools Database (Sqlite)
Use DB Browser to view and modify the database. Click on the `Execute SQL` tab to execute SQL code for debugging.

# Building for Production
Run the command `cargo tauri build` to build the project for production. This will take a long time to build. After the application has finished building a .msi file and a .exe file should be created. These files can be found in `\testcage\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\msi\` and `\testcage\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\` folder. Use either .msi or .exe to install the application on any Windows Computer.

# Frontend (Typescript React)
The Frontend (UI) is build using Typescript [React](https://react.dev/reference/react). Some libraries used include [Redux-Tool-Kit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/usage-guide) for state management and Material UI ([MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/)) for most of the React components. All the frontend code cand be found in `/test-cage/src/`.
## File Structure
```
- src
    - assets // Used to store .css files and other assets to modify the looks of components
    - enums // Folder to store all the enums used throughout the application.
    - features // Folder to store all the feature components such as navigation bars, forms, tables, etc.
    - hooks // Folder to store all the hooks. Hooks are basically functions that handle logic, state, fetch data, etc that can be used over multiple components. 
    - pages // Folder to store all the pages.
    - slices // Folder used to store slices. Slices are a part of Redux tool kit which is a bit complicated to explain so there will be a separate section explaining this.
    - types // Folder to store all the types use through out the frontend
    - utils // Folder to store utility functions use in multiple components
    App.tsx
    main.tsx
    store.ts // Used for Redux tool kit
    vite-env.d.ts 
```
## Redux Tool Kit
Library used for state management. Think of `state` as a collection of all the information that the application needs to function like user settings and data. The information store in this `state` can be accessed in components in the frontend using `useAppSelector()`. For example `const editStatus = useAppSelector((state) => state.appSettings.editMode);` will access the state of `appSettings` and the property `editMode`. A `slice` is a way Redux tool kit used to organize and manage specific parts of the `state`. To modify a state, we create `reducers` (we write reducers in a slice check out the reducers folder for examples) which are pure functions that will determine how states should be modified. To use these reducers to modify the state, we use `const dispatch: AppDispatch = useAppDispatch();` and to execute a reducer we use `dispatch(showSnackBar("Test Fixture Already Exist"));`. In this example we execute the reducer `showSnackBar()` found in `/test-cage/src/slices/snackBarSlice.ts` to set the `message` field to the input message and `open` field to `true`. [Redux-tool-kit-documentation](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/usage-guide).

## Material UI (MUI)
Library containing premade customizable premade components such as Lists and Tables for fast development. Documentation for all [MUI-components ](https://mui.com/material-ui/all-components/).

# Backend (Rust)
The backend is built using Rust. The crates [sqlx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) is used to communicate with the sqlite database asynchronously.

# Tauri Features
Useful features built into the Tauri framework.

## Calling Rusting functions from React
[Documentation](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/command/) for calling rust from frontend. To call a rust function from react you must create a `command` in the backend by annotating the function with the `#[command]` tag. Functions annotated with this tag must return a `Result` type. Any custom struct in the parameter of the function and result of the function must have the annotation `#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]`. The Error within the result type must contain an Error that can be serialized. Some crates can contain errors that cannot be serialized so you must serialize them yourself. You can find out how to custom serializable errors in [error-handling](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/command/). If you want to access the database in this function you have to include the parameter `(pool_state: State<'_, SqlitePoolConnection>)` in the function. If you want to access the app handle add the generic `<R: Runtime>` to the function and include the parameter `(app_handle: AppHandle<R>)`. After creating a new command add the name of the function inside `generate_handler![]` list that is typically found at the very bottom of the file. Use Tauriâ€™s built in function `invoke<T>` (the T is the expected type of the result returned) to call rust functions by passing in the name of the command and pass in the necessary parameter. Use `.then` to handle the response from the function call and `.catch` to handle any errors. For example, in the code snippet below we can see that the rust function being called is `add_test_sample` and this function is in `plugin:sqlite_connector` (this is changed if the rust function is not in `sqlite_connector.rs`) The argument passed in is item. In this case the result from the `add_test_sample` call is just logged but if you want to use the value, you can use `useState<T>()` and set the state to the value and return the value. The error is logged, and a snack bar notification is displayed in the UI to let the user know that an error occurred.
```Typescript
    const addTestSample = (item:TestSample):void => {
        invoke<number>("plugin:sqlite_connector|add_test_sample", { item: item })
            .then((res) => console.log(res))
            .catch((err) => {
                console.log(err);
                dispatch(showSnackBar("Test Sample Already Exist"));
            });
    }
```
## Managing Rust State
Tauri allows for state management in the rust code. This can be useful if you want to access a state in multiple functions. For example, in this application the data base fool state is managed since you need pool to perform database operations. An example of how to manage a state is shown below. In this code snippet the database is initialized, and it will return a `Result<Pool<Sqlite>, SqlxError>`. If the database is initialized successfully we create a new State using `app_handle.state();` and then we set the value of the state.
```Rust
    #[derive(Debug)]
    pub struct SqlitePoolConnection{
      pub connection: Mutex<Option<Pool<Sqlite>>>
    }

    ...

    .setup(|app_handler| {
      let app_handle = app_handler.app_handle();
      tauri::async_runtime::spawn(async move {
        match initialize_sqlite_database().await {
          Ok(pool) => {
            log::info!("Database initalized");
            let pool_state: State<'_, SqlitePoolConnection> = app_handle.state();
            *pool_state.connection.lock().unwrap() = Some(pool.clone());            
          }
          Err(err) => {log::error!("Error Initializing Database: {}", err);}
        }
      });
      Ok(())
    })
```

## Global Application Shortcuts
Tauri allows for global shortcuts. In this application the shortcut `alt+enter` is used to open up the app settings dialog that lets the user turn on edit mode, export database, and import database. To change this short cut you can do to `/src/features/settings/components/appSettings.tsx`. To create a new shortcut we use the hook `registerShortCut` found in `/src/hooks/index/ts`. This hook takes in the shortcut as a `string` and a function that handles the shortcut when the shortcut is pressed. An example of registering a new shortcut is shown below.
```Typescript
    export const registerShortCut = (shortCut:string, shortCutHandler:ShortCutHandler):void => {
        useEffect(() => {
            register(shortCut, shortCutHandler)
                .then(() => console.log(`Registered Shortcut: ${shortCut}`))
                .catch(() => {});
        })
    }

    ...

    const settingsShortCut:string = "Alt+Enter";
    const toggleAppSettings = useCallback(debounce(() => {
        setOpenAppSettings(true);
    }, 500), []);
    registerShortCut(settingsShortCut, toggleAppSettings);
```
